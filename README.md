# ELEC/CPEN 291 Project
Code for our robot for the Summer 2016 session of ELEC/CPEN 291 the second year project course.

This robot will find 6 coloured cylenders out of 8 possilbe slots shown below. It will show the colour on an LED (red, blue, or green) and attack the red objects. It is started by bluetooth from the Proccessing GUI and updates this GUI with the info it gathers (colours and positions). Out of the 5 groups in this session our robot was the fastest at a time of 1:43 to find all objects and return to the center
